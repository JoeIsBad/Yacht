Yacht converted from GTA 5 Mods to a FiveM resource I take no credit for this model all credits go to the amazing RsMods.

Original link to model: https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/sear-ray-650-express-add-on-replace

Once again massive thank you to RsMods for creating and giving me permission to upload this to FiveM.

Uploading this bc I've noticed there is barley any boats uploaded on the FiveM forums/none that pretty much work.

Install:

Drag and drop the file "Yacht" into your resources folder.
Add "Yacht" to your server.cfg and clear your cache.
Restart your server and it spawn the model "yacht2" via a menu.
